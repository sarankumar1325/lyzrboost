   - Long-term storage capabilities
   - Context window optimization

3. Workflow Controls
   - Max iterations and timeout settings
   - Conditional execution paths
   - Error handling and recovery strategies

4. Debugging Tools
   - Detailed logging of agent interactions
   - Token usage tracking
   - Performance metrics and bottleneck identification

5. Advanced Features
   - Human-in-the-loop capabilities
   - Custom tool integration
   - External API connectors
